# easyio
A simple application to test connectivity and experiment with node.js deployement models. This is an accompanying app 
for YouTube series - **"Deploying Node"** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQlWzK5tU-gDyxC1JTpyC2avvJlt3hrIh

Check out the deployed version at https://nanogram.io

# Building locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Project Structure
The node.js app contains only one file - main.js. There are some static files to present a (reasonably awkward) 
UI in "public" folder.

Configs used for nginx are in `conf/nginx` folder
